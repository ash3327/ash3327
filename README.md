 - Deep Q-Learning Shooter Game Project ‚ÄúSnowFight‚Äù [Group Project] (October - December 2022) #Python #ReinforcementLearning
   - Created a Gym environment of a simple third-person shooter game in Python
   - Led the project and planned an efficient work schedule, while collaborating closely with groupmate throughout the development
   - Implemented a simple Deep-Q Network with PyTorch to train agents to master at the game (left image)
   - Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the agent, achieving average kill streak of 7 (right image, top) and lengthend the survival duration by 4 times (right image, bottom), which significantly better than the random baseline of 0.22 kills on average.

**Work in the past:**
 - Image Segmentation (YOLO-v5) [Self Learning] (June 2023) #Python
   - Applied the YOLO-v5 model for real-time tracking of cars.
   - Referred to an online tutorial while doing so.
   - Applied Abrewley's Sort Library and self-implemented instance label assigning function based on maximum overlap to stablize the labelled id on each car moving across frames.

 - RegSubjer [Self Project] (v1 on August 2021, v2 reworked on January 2022) #Java
    - Helps students register their courses (especially those in CUHK) efficiently.
    - Users can set a fixed time when the required mouse click is enforced.
    - Time synchronized with HKO clock.
    - Author has been using this application to register his courses for 6 times, involving a robotics course that only has 3 vacancies, and has not failed in getting a position in the course.
    - After frame-by-frame inspection on recorded video on the demonstration, we found that the time delay between actual time and the click time is no larger than 1.5 frames, that is, around 50 ms, which is faster than human response which is typically around 200-300 ms.
